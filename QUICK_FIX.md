# Quick Fix for GitHub Pages 404

## ⚡ Fastest Solution (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/SUMITKC1/Support-System-design-In-Coal-Mine-Galleries-and-Junctions/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
3. Select **Branch**: `main`
4. Select **Folder**: `/ (root)`
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 2: Check Your Site
Visit: https://SUMITKC1.github.io/Support-System-design-In-Coal-Mine-Galleries-and-Junctions/

## 🎯 Alternative: Use GitHub Actions

If you want to use GitHub Actions:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SUMITKC1/Support-System-design-In-Coal-Mine-Galleries-and-Junctions/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select: **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Go to **Actions** tab
5. Click **"Run workflow"** on "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
6. Wait for completion

## ✅ Verify It Works

After enabling, check:
- Settings → Pages should show your site URL
- Actions tab should show successful workflow run
- Site should load (may take 2-5 minutes)

## 🆘 Still 404?

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** (first deployment is slower)
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. **Check Actions tab** for errors
4. **Verify repository is public** (Settings → General → Danger Zone)
5. **Check branch name** is `main` (not `master`)

## 📝 Important Notes

- Repository name in URL is **case-sensitive**
- First deployment takes **2-5 minutes**
- Site updates automatically on every push to `main`
- Make sure repository is **public** (free GitHub Pages requirement)
